<p style="font-size:1.5em">
This is my first repository trying to learn web development. 
<br>
<br>
Here I attempted to complete Bro Code free four hour HTML and CSS course, as well as do experiments with what I've learned. My main objective is to, in the end, have a fully responsive website design with just HTML and CSS. 
<br>
The "main goal" of this whole repository is to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS so I can make the best UX&UI design in my future websites.
